# TSCFootbot-RCJ-LWL-PCB
This public repository contains the electrical schematic of the 2024 lightweight robot, the bottom layer PCB used for line detecting, and the top layer PCB used for everything else basically.

The purpose of the two PCBs was to avoid wires that made the whole build a bit messy and to make the whole robot a lot more modular. Another advantage of the top layer is the distance between IR sensors as before we used a sensor in this configuration:https://www.microline.hr/EUWeb/EUWeb/HTML.ashx?_command=showItem&itemKey=mrm-ir-finder3 . But now we were able to desolder it to have a wider distance between each sensor which helps with ball detection.

NOTE: This is the first PCB I have made of this size, so industry standards and practices were barely taken into consideration while making it.
